## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- CRUD: create, read, update, delete tasks
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My Process

## My Experience with Prisma

🚀

Getting `Prisma` up and running for the first time can be a bit **challenging**, just like with any database. However, what’s great about Prisma is how **quickly** I can set it up without needing to open another app, like with MongoDB. I **highly** recommend it!

One of the best things about Prisma is its seamless integration into my workflow. Unlike MongoDB, which often requires additional tools or interfaces, Prisma provides a **unified solution** that allows me to manage my database directly within my project. This makes development much more **efficient** and **time-saving**.

### What I Learned

🎯

- Setting up Prisma with Next.js and PostgreSQL
- Using Prisma Migrate for database schema changes
- Efficient querying with Prisma Client

---

### Continued Development

🔥

-> For my future projects, I plan to switch to **PostgreSQL** to take full advantage of its **advanced types and scalability features**. Additionally, I aim to improve my proficiency with my tech stack as a whole, since I'll be working on numerous **personal and career-based projects**.
-> To make a **daily refresh** and to **check if it is daily** kind of attributes, that will be added as labels in the todo ui, for enabling editing, and in the current schema, so it saves:
```
model Todo {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  input     String
  done      Boolean  @default(false)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  order     Int      @default(0)
  // Viitoare implementare pentru Daily Refresh:
  // isDaily   Boolean  @default(false)
}
```

### My Tech Stack

💡

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Styling & UI:** Tailwind CSS with Shadcn, Daisy UI, Framer Motion, Magic UI
- **Backend & Database:** Prisma, PostgreSQL
- **Testing & Validation:** Vitest, Jest, Testing Library, Zod

Staying consistent and improving my skills with these technologies is my top priority! 🚀
